Joke of the Week!

Hey, what’s a robot's favorite snack?

Microchips!

Our biggest project this week was researching grant and funding opportunities, we’re looking around at local robotics companies, and drafting some emails for outreach. We’ve also been on the hunt for another mentor so that we can be an official team! FTC requires that a team has 2 mentors to compete.

If you happen to be out there, reading this blog, somewhere in the universe, anywhere, please be our mentor!

Our awesome, talented, and super chill lead build engineer David attempted to get an old 3D printing up and running, but the task was more daunting than initially expected. We are contemplating selling it for parts because as we alluded to before, we need money.

In regards to our actual robot, we looked at the kit we recently bought and are excited to start building! We have a solid concept for a base, but to build an outstanding robot, we need to acquire more specific parts, which again, we cannot afford.

We are super excited to get this season going (even if we are a little behind) and are looking forward to our first scrimmage in early December!
